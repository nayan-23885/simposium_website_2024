AI can largely improve diagnosis, ensuring early detection of diseases and effectively sharing globally the clinical expertise currently available only at major referral centers. Robots can help surgeons perform better quality operations, helping to reduce hospital stays and the impact of surgeries on patients' post-operative quality of life. In particular, AI and robotics can be of great help in precision medical treatments, such in ENT cancer care. Diseases in the upper aero-digestive tract (UADT) are challenging to detect and correctly diagnose at early stages, and operations can have a strong negative side effects, such as causing changes to speech, chewing and swallowing capabilities. Operations in this anatomical region present stringent requirements for precision and control of surgical tools, which makes them very interesting for robotics and AI technologies. In this talk, I will present the translational research being conducted at IIT (Genoa, Italy) and by the AIRCARE European project consortium to address key questions in precision medical treatment of UADT diseases using novel sensors, robotic systems and artificial intelligence. These include innovations in mechatronics, perception and surgeon-robot interfaces aimed at introducing new technologies into the challenging surgical specialty of laryngology." data-bb="Leonardo S.

            <div class="Speaker_layer" data-ti="Autopilot Inspired Artificial Pancreas for Type-1 Diabetic Patients of India" data-ab="Type-1 diabetic patients have pancreatic failure and are incapable of secreting any insulin to the blood plasma. Hence, if untreated, they cannot live for long time. The current practice, which is largely followed in the world, is through daily multiple insulin injections. Unfortunately, however, besides being a painful practice, it normally leads to gross inaccuracies, thereby not being able to harvest the full potential of insulin. Fortunately, commercially available insulin pumps are now available which can be programmed to deliver the desired amount of insulin in a very slow rate. However, because they operate continuously for a long time, inaccuracies in manual programming also leads to inaccuracies leading to glucose excursions beyond the desired limits. To address this issue, the current in the world is to develop robust closed-loop feedback system, called artificial pancreas, where a small amount of insulin is continuously infused to the patient’s body through the subcutaneous route by an insulin pump, depending on the situation of the patient as sensed by the subcutaneous CGM sensor.

            This talk will give an overview of the Artificial Pancreas (AP) concept, followed by the specific activities being carried out by the speaker at the Indian Institute of Science, in collaboration with MS Ramaiah Medical, in Bangalore, towards development of an effective artificial pancreas system for Type-1 diabetic patients of India. A large part of this research has been inspired by the speaker’s experience in designing AP (auto-pilot) systems for aerospace systems. From a modest beginning in 2017, substantial progress has been made in both back-end and front-end developments, leading to successful lab testing followed by clinical trials under controlled environment. The current status of this research as well as the future plan of action towards realizing this dream will be outlined in this talk." data-bb="Prof. Radhakant Padhi is currently working as the HAL Chair Professor in the Department of Aerospace engineering and as an Associate Faculty at the Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

            <div class="Speaker_layer" data-ti="Digital Scalpel: Precise and Personalized Surgical Care" data-ab="The imperative for surgical automation lies in its potential to reduce preventable errors and significantly improve patient outcomes. Robotic surgery has already demonstrated its success and gained acceptance among clinicians and patients, offering greater precision and minimally invasive options. However, the current reliance on master-slave systems reveals limitations, highlighting the need for more advanced automation, intelligent robots, and decision support systems that can autonomously adapt and improve during surgery. A key challenge in advancing these technologies is the historical and unstructured nature of clinical data, which hinders the development of robust AI models. Furthermore, there is a gap between technological advancements and domain expertise, making it difficult to fully realize AI's potential in surgical sciences. To address these issues, interactive collaboration between technological experts and clinicians is essential for creating validated models that incorporate effective human feedback, and deploying these models in clinical settings will enable continuous refinement. The integration of AI and automation in surgery promises to transform patient care by enhancing precision, reducing errors, and personalizing treatment. However, the high costs associated with advanced surgical tools underscore the need for cost-effective business solutions to ensure wider accessibility. A unified effort within the medical community is needed, one that emphasizes collaboration, continuous learning, data-driven approaches, and innovative cost strategies. The vision for the future is one where digital scalpels powered by AI become essential tools in every surgeon's repertoire, leading to safer, more efficient, and personalized surgical care for all." data-bb="Mahendra Bhandari is an Indian surgeon who has made substantial contributions to the specialty of urology, medical training, hospital administration, robotic surgery and medical ethics.

            <div class="Speaker_layer" data-ti="Architecting Directional Anisotropy in Shape Morphing Soft
            Magnetic Actuators" data-ab="Magnetoactive shape morphing soft magnetic materials (MASMA) are comprised of a soft
            polymer matrix impregnated with magnetic particles that display multifunctionality in the
            magnetic field. The arrangement and magnetization direction of the magnetic particles in the
            polymer matrix play a pivotal role in defining the deformation direction and actuation capacity.
            Traditionally, to program the magnetic material for a specific shape, it needs to be poured into
            a required-shaped mould in its green state to rearrange the magnetic particles and fix the
            magnetization direction. The moulding technique of shape programming is a tedious and
            complex process, and the requirement of specifically shaped mould limits the applications. The
            current work is focused on generating the required shape in the magnetic actuator using the
            magnetostriction effect. To generate different shapes, we need specifically shaped mould;
            hence, a particle arrangement mimicking strategy is developed to generate the desired shape to
            eradicate the need for a mould. At first, some basic shapes programmed using the moulding
            process are prepared and examined under a microscope to understand the arrangement of the
            particles. Then, the particle arrangement pattern is mimicked using the magnetic brick units by
            arranging in the required direction. Brick-shaped magnetic units with soft magnetic particles
            aligned anisotropically at different angles are prepared by applying the magnetic field to the
            material in its green state at different angles. The magnetic material with microparticles is cured
            in the aligned state and removed from the brick mould after curing. These magnetic brick units
            with particles oriented at different angles are then placed in the required arrangement, and then
            brick units are glued to each other using a flexible polymer mortar layer. The actuator generates
            the required shape in the magnetic field due to the magnetostriction effect. Using an
            electromagnetic setup, the pattern-mimicked shapes are tested for shape morphology and
            actuation capacity. Results show that we can generate many shapes by controlling the direction
            of the magnetic moment by arranging the magnetic brick units in the different arrangements." data-bb="Prof. Sivakumar M Srinivasan, who signs off as Anbudan Siva, is a Professor and

However, such robotic arm manipulators are enormously expensive due to the rigidity of the manipulator arm which needs high power servo motors. Reduction of Arm rigidity may reduce the actuation cost but would invariably increase the probability of vibration transmission at the distal ends sacrificing the positional accuracy of the manipulators. In this talk, I would talk about different strategies for vibration control of flexible surgical arm manipulators with the application of smart material based meta-structures. I will discuss how the concept of meta-structure can facilitate the creation of attenuation band-gap in the manipulator. I will also show some of our recent works on smart material based meta-structures which may be used to actively control the band-width. Thus, an effective control of vibration propagation in the manipulator is envisaged to be suitable for high positional accuracy of the system." data-bb="

In the decision making process in the driver, three types of ability are discussed as cognition, judgment, and operation (or control). From the perspective of utilizing data-driven artificial intelligence such as machine learning, remarkable progress has been acknowledged. There are high expectations for statistical models and generative models based on big data, which it involves problems of judgments being black-boxed and an unclear consistency between machine-based judgements and human skilled judgments. We have explored the design of brain-inspired intelligent systems from the perspectives of the brain, the body, and society. In particular, we have focused on the importance of episodic memory, which allows us to consciously trace memories, as opposed to implicit memory circuits, and have focused on the use of semantic web technology based on predicate logic. This can provide a database of expert knowledge (ontology DB) through a systematic description of knowledge known as ontology and applying it to real-time verification with the situation in the real-world environment on time.

            In this talk, I would like to explain an overview of ontology DB and discuss how it is possible to systematize human expert knowledge, as the formal AI. As concrete examples, I will present research results, such biological measurements of expert human bus drivers when they are driving in a complex situation. Those biological measurements from human experts who normally take an accurate decision making in an exact moment depending on the context are important for the basement data to design automated systems with highly sensitive high precision.

This requires development of alternative devices to help these patients. To this end, several devices are being developed worldwide to treat CVDs. These include left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and percutaneous ventricular assist device (PVAD). Implantable LVAD, a device that supports the left ventricle pump blood into the aorta, is considered a destination therapy device. On the other hand, PVAD is a bridge to therapy device that is deployed temporarily during cardiac recovery. While these devices provide solutions for patients suffering due to weak heart and heart failure, however, they are very expensive for Indian population. In this context, our work focusses on development of these two devices with better performance than the currently available devices at affordable price.

AI is used as an umbrella term for the scientific discipline that focuses on the wide range of algorithmic programmes and models to perform numerous complex tasks constituting the application of mathematics, statistics, and computer sciences to mimic the simulation of intelligent behaviour. There is a wide spectrum of AI technologies that are being used in healthcare services such as machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANN), deep learning (DL), computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), fuzzy logics, robotics, and cybernetics. Machine learning has the potential in making diagnosis based on imaging, assessing disease severity, and contributing to health policy and planning. Intraoperative video can be analysed with computer vision (CV) which can help in reliable identification of surgical steps and tools across a range of operations. The use of NLP to extract surgical outcomes from electronic health records, particularly postoperative problems, is growing across disciplines. Reinforcement learning has the potential to assist in surgical decision-making by recommending actions at predefined intervals which mimics a human trial-and-error learning process to calculate optimum recommendation policies. Fuzzy logic inference has been used as a sensitive method of predicting patients who fail to improve with surgical intervention which employs the principles of contingent probability and involves the recognition of intermediate logical values. Cybernetics and robotic surgeries are additional transdisciplinary domains that may help to augment and enhance the ability to do some surgical procedures safely.

However, its use in cardiothoracic surgery has lagged in comparison to other surgical branches. This can be understood best by the value that robot adds to the surgery as well as its limitations. Robot gives the advantage of very high 3 D resolution with magnification to 20X and instrument controls gives surgeon the same perspective of surgical field as in open surgery, rather better. The other advantage of robot is precise dissection which is almost bloodless and the skills of operating are similar to open surgery. These capabilities enable surgeon to perform the procedure in the same way as he had practiced but with a very clear vision and precision of movement. These aspects help in performing thoracic surgeries with precision as they are mainly ablative (dissection based) in nature. However, cardiac surgeries are more complex as the reconstruction is added to the task apart from dissection. Reconstruction is further complicated as it is for small vessels and cardiac chambers which are very soft and fragile. Some of cardiac surgeries are to be done on beating heart which beats with vigorous and spiral force. This kind of movement is a challenge for technology to hold with long instruments based on pulleys and hinges. The last challenge is holding and knotting sutures without breaking them in absence of force feedback. These challenges delayed the development of robotic cardiac surgery considering it was first branch to start robotic use for surgery." data-bb="To be added soon..." onclick="opendetails()">

However, patients with moderate to severe paralysis often have minimal or no volitional control of their limbs and hence, are unable to operate existing devices during therapy. To overcome this limitation, in this talk we will present two novel control paradigms that require minimal or no physical movement in order to operate a rehabilitation device. 
            The first paradigm, known as a brain-machine interface (BMI), can decode a paralyzed individual’s movement intentions directly from their brain activity, measured via electroencephalography (EEG). We will present the efficacy of this approach with the help of a clinical trial conducted in chronic stroke survivors where participants used a BMI-based exoskeleton to receive upper-limb therapy. 
            The second paradigm, called a body-machine interface (BoMI), capitalizes on the availability of any surviving limb movements in paralyzed individuals together with low cost, rapidly deployable inertial and computer vision-based sensors to infer their movement objectives. We will present a few examples of successful BoMI implementations and its use in controlling a wearable FES device to restore grasping.
            The talk will end by introducing a novel “passive BMI” paradigm, wherein a patient themself monitors the behavior of a rehabilitation device and generates corrective actions (via EEG) whenever the device commits an error in movement.

Magnetic soft actuators exhibit a reversible change in shape and size when kept under the influence of the magnetic field. The change in their shape and size in the magnetic field is significantly large and fast compared to the other stimuli active actuators. These magnetic soft actuators comprise a soft polymer matrix and magnetic particles as fillers. Actuators with soft magnetic particles programmed with different shapes are prepared and analyzed under a high-magnification microscope to understand the orientation configuration of the micro-carbonyl Iron (CI) particles, which are responsible for shape generation. The configuration pattern of CI particle chains in programmed shape is then mimicked using thin iron needles with a high aspect ratio of 1:15 to 1:20 in a silicon matrix. Due to the magnetostriction effect in iron needles, it is possible to control the shape of the soft actuators just by controlling the orientation and alignment of these iron needles. The fabricated soft actuator is then tested for reversible shape change in the magnetic field and the effect of the magnetic field on the amount of deformation or actuation. Further, a soft gripper and a soft locomoting robot are prepared to investigate the motion generated by the shape change." data-bb=" Mr. Dharmi Chand is a Research Scholar at IIT Madras in the Department of Applied Mechanics, under the guidance of Prof. Sivakumar M Srinivasan.

            <div class="Speaker_layer" data-ti="Real time, Non-Invasive and Cost-Effective Blood Glucose Monitoring Using
            NIR Spectroscopy." data-ab="Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that significantly affects vital organs and is
            rapidly becoming a widespread lifestyle disease. Regular monitoring and maintaining
            blood glucose levels within the normal range can help prevent complications.
            However, most commercially available glucose measurement devices are invasive.
            While minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have been
            introduced, they remain costly. With the rising prevalence of diabetes, particularly in
            low- and middle-income countries, there is a growing need for a cost-effective, easyto-use, non-invasive glucose monitoring solution.
            This paper presents a promising approach by utilizing near-infrared (NIR) light to
            penetrate the skin and interact with blood glucose molecules. The resulting absorption
            spectra, generated from the interaction between NIR light and glucose molecules, are
            processed by a microprocessor. Through the application of a linear regression model,
            these spectra are analyzed to accurately estimate glucose levels in real time.
            Preliminary results for the device indicate an accuracy of approximately 93%,
            comparable to existing glucose monitoring systems. This development represents a
            significant step forward in the development of non-invasive glucose monitoring
            systems, with the potential to improve patient compliance, reduce health-care costs,
            and ultimately enhance diabetes management." data-bb="To be added soon..." onclick="opendetails()">

            <div class="Speaker_layer" data-ti="Cerebral Monitoring during Surgeries and Critical Care" data-ab="Clinical procedures associated with critical care like major surgeries, interventions involve high risk. Therefore, Operation theatres (OTs), Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are equipped with advanced medical technology and equipment to navigate the risks [1]. Here, patient monitors play a vital role as they help healthcare professionals detect changes in a patient's vital signs and respond quickly. Patient monitors provide insights like temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate etc. but lack any useful insights about the state and functioning of the brain. Knowing the state of the brain whether conscious or unconscious is essential during major surgeries where general anaesthesia is administered [2]. On the other hand, knowing whether brain is functioning appropriately or not is even more critical during and post operative procedures [3].
            One of the advanced technologies that tells the unconscious level (depth of anaesthesia) during surgeries is called Bi-spectral index (BIS). Using BIS monitor helps to optimize the dose of anaesthesia and prevent consequences of underdose/overdose [2]. Another advance technology that monitors brain functioning is cerebral oximetry, which tells the oxygen saturation in the brain as a marker for brain functioning [3] [4]. Presently, there are no efficient and affordable equipment for monitoring depth of anaesthesia and cerebral oximetry. Existing equipment to monitor the depth of anaesthesia (BIS monitor) and cerebral oxygenation are undermined with several limitations e.g. separate devices, but both are used at the same location (frontal head) making it tedious to set up. Other major limitations are high procurement and operating cost due to imported consumables. 
            We present an indigenous device that combines both i.e., BIS as well as cerebral oximetry. Such a device would be cost effective and easy to set up, while also serving both the purposes with a single equipment, saving cost and setup time for clinicians. It would help managing the risk during critical care by simultaneously monitor depth of anaesthesia and cerebral oxygen i.e., telling insights about brain state and its function. Innovations to support patient life in OTs and ICUs serves a critical purpose and is therefore of a high impact. Our proposal for innovating and making the technology affordable and easy would increase the adoption and assist in saving more lives.

We want to use a humanoid robot, NAO to interact with the child and understand how the gestures are interchanged. Autistic children have difficulty in communication and social interaction but they have been seen to have better response with robots. Through several experiments we want to know how NAO can be used in daily day to day activities with these children and how incorporating NAO can aid the children with autism to improve their learning, reacting and interacting. It will also help us know the benefit of making them learn these new things and social interactions from an early age for their benefit and care." data-bb="To be added soon..." onclick="opendetails()">

            <div class="Speaker_layer" data-ti="Design and development of escalator/stair climbing wheelchair" data-ab="The strength of our bones and muscles generally deteriorates after a certain age, resulting in some physical disabilities. The severity of the problem usually increases with age. Occasionally, physical disabilities can be caused by some mishaps as well. The issue is becoming more threatening with the rapid aging of the worldwide population. Hence, extensive research is being carried out towards the development of assistive devices for elderly and disabled people.  In the field of assistive technologies, many devices have been developed which are effective for human commutation. The first wheelchair is reported to have been developed in 1783 and since then it has undergone momentous evolution. In the current scenario, electric wheelchairs are being widely used by paraplegic people.
            In a fast-moving and busy lifestyle, Escalators play an important role in the commuting of people at multi-story buildings, airports, railway stations, shopping malls, etc. Although electric wheelchairs have been very effective, one of the major challenges faced by users is the inability to climb on Escalators.
            In this presentation, a novel and simplified escalator climbing wheelchair will be illustrated. While climbing up or down on the escalator, the inclination angle of the wheelchair varies drastically which causes safety threats for the rider. Hence, a linkage based mechanism is proposed to compensate for any change in the inclination angle. An inertial measuring sensor is attached to the wheelchair, which will continuously monitor the variation in the inclination angle of the wheelchair. The data will then be fed to a microcontroller, to process the inclination angle data, which will generate the actuation signals accordingly. These output signals from the microcontroller will control the length of the linear actuator of the slider-crank mechanism to dynamically change the inclination angle of the wheelchair and keep the wheelchair horizontal to the ground. Thus, while climbing on an escalator toppling can be avoided.
